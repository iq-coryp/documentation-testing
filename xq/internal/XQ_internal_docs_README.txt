All of the files in this folder contain internal facing endpoints that were deemed unnecessary to the March 2012 Hackathon attendees. 

The files appended with '_int' are files that have a corresponding file in the external facing documents. The external files
contain only external content, the internal files contain only internal content. 

Topics in this folder without '_int' appended to the name are files that were deemed internal in their entirety.

These topics are are laid out in the same way as the external facing files. However, there are several endpoints that have no
"response" as it was decided that internal facing endpoints were not a priority for the hackathon. 

If these endpoints are added back into the API document (index.md) at some point, the responses will need to be added, and there
are several notes (comments in the HTML style) in the files that will need to be addressed.

I have also included the XQ_API_Documentation.md file here. This file contains an older version of the API before I implemented
snippets. I thought it might be nice to have as a back up in case things go pear shaped.
