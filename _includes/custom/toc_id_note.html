Make sure you leave the `with_toc_data` option included. This auto-creates an ID for each Markdown-formatted heading, which then gets injected into the mini-TOC. Without this auto-creation of IDs, the mini-TOC won't include the heading. If you ever use HTML formatting for headings, you need to manually add an ID attribute to the heading in order for the heading to appear in the mini-TOC.
