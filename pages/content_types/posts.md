summary: "Posts are designed for blog-like entries. This theme hasn't been designed with much functionality around posts. It's assumed you're using pages for everything."

{% include linkrefs.html %} 

Most of the theme is designed for using pages, but you can also use posts. Posts are intended for blog entries. They have dates in the filenames, and they sort chronologically when get the posts. Create posts inside the _posts folder.

The latest_posts.html file shows the latest posts. The tagindex.html file sorts posts by tags. The archive.html sorts posts by date.

{{note}} I haven't done much testing with posts, so you may run into some snags there. I'm planning to convert my blog (idratherbewriting.com) to Jekyll using this same theme, and when I do, I'll iron out all the issues with posts. {{end}}
