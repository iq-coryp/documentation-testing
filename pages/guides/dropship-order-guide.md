## Overview

The following document outlines the APIs and calls required for a dropship integration with iQmetrix. The steps outlined in this guide are focused on order management and are meant to be performed sequentially. 

Each segment in this guide will provide high-level concepts before describing examples of the API call required.

<img src="{{ "/images/order-flow.jpg" | prepend: site.url }}" alt="dropship order diagram" />

The following topics will be covered in this guide:

* [Authentication](/api/authentication)
* [Supplier Orders](/api/supplier-orders)


#### Who Is This Guide For?

The intended audience for this guide are developers who are integrating a supplier into the iQmetrix dropship program.

#### Prior Steps

Prior to starting this guide, the steps outlined in the [Dropship Onboarding Guide](/guides/dropship-onboarding-guide) must be completed. The prerequisite for this guide is to have dropship orders created in a retail application, such as RQ, that includes a customer or store address.

In order to generate test order data you must consult with <a href="mailto:{{site.support_email}}?subject=Dropship Order Test Data">API Support</a>.

#### Environment

iQmetrix provides you with two environments: Sandbox and Production. 
Use the Sandbox environment to test your API and to perform end-to-end testing. After completing this stage proceed to the Production environment.

For more information on environments, see {{Environments}}.

The iQmetrix API supports JSON and JSON + HAL. See [Supported Response Formats](/api/getting-started) for more information.


## Step 1 - Authentication

In order to make authorized requests to iQmetrix APIs, you need an {{AccessToken_Glossary}}.

See the table below for different ways of getting an Access Token.

| If... | Then... |
|:------|:--------|
| You do not have an Access Token | See [Obtaining an Access Token](/api/authentication/#obtaining-an-access-token) |
| You have an Access Token, but it is close to expiring | See [Refreshing an Access Token](/api/authentication/#refreshing-an-access-token) |

The token is placed in the `Authorization` header of requests to iQmetrix APIs, prefixed by the word `Bearer`.

##### Example Request

    Authorization: Bearer (Access Token)


## Step 2 - Getting Dropship Orders

The [Order Feed](/api/supplier-orders) allows you to get a list of the latest orders created for dropship, and is encoded as atom+xml.

When reading the order entry, one of two shipping addresses are given: the store address or the customer address. The differentiator between these addresses will be in the `type` field under the `shipping-address` resource.

<img src="{{ "/images/order-feed.jpg" | prepend: site.url }}" alt="dropship order feed" />



### 2.1 Getting the Order Feed

The Order Feed is broken into two order types: `order-created` and `order-status-updated`. Type `order-created` is generated by the client (e.g. RQ) while `order-status-updated` is generated by the supplier. Each resource has its own definition and is setup as separate entries in the Order Feed.

The dropship `order-id` is found in the Order Feed under the order type. This dropship `order-id` is separate from the order ID that is generated by the retailer. Use the dropship `order-id` when updating the status of your orders.

To get the latest Order Feed entries, see [Getting the Order Feed](/api/supplier-orders/#getting-order-feed).

##### Example Request

    GET https://dropshipdemo.iqmetrix.net/v1/Suppliers(60455)/Notifications
    Authorization: Bearer (Access Token)
    Accept: application/atom+xml

## Step 3: Updating Orders

The [Order Status Update](/api/supplier-orders) allows you to provide status updates to dropship orders as you receive them, based on the dropship `order-id`. iQmetrix gives you a number of [status](/api/supplier-orders/#orderstatus) options to choose from when mapping to with your inventory system.

<img src="{{ "/images/order-status.jpg" | prepend: site.url }}" alt="dropship order status" />

#### Order Statuses

When a dropship order is created, it is automatically assigned the `PendingSupplier` state by the dropship service. Once you pick up the order, it is your responsibility to change the status based on your shipping practices. The most common statuses have been provided by iQmetrix. 

There are two scenarios when updating the status of an order: 

1. All items are available and a full shipment is sent
2. One or more items are not available and the order requires [partial shipment](#optional-partial-shipments) 

It is recommended to hold the order (e.g. `BackOrdered`) until all items are available and in-stock to reduce the risks involved with partial shipping.

Should your system statuses differ greatly from the ones provided, you may use either the `Other` state or contact <a href="mailto:{{site.support_email}}?subject=Dropship Order States">API Support</a> to find an appropriate solution. 


#### Complete Order Flow Diagram

The diagram below demonstrates all possible states when a full shipment occurs.

<img src="{{ "/images/order-full-flow.jpg" | prepend: site.url }}" alt="dropship full order states" />


#### Notifying the End Customer 

Once you have changed the order status or item status to `Shipped`, an email will be sent out to the end customer. In the case of item status update, only one email is sent out, regardless if multiple items have the `Shipped` status. 

It is the responsibility of the courier to notify the end customer when their shipment is en route. The customer's phone number is provided under `shipping-customer` in the Order Feed. 

Should the customer not provide a phone number, it is recommended to contact the store via the `location-id` parameter under `seller` in the Order Feed.

### 3.1 Updating the Order Status

{{note}} It is <strong>highly recommended</strong> to only handle complete orders and update the order status rather than handle partial shipments. {{end}}

Partial shipments are supported but are currently limited. See [Partial Shipments](#optional-partial-shipments) for more information.

You must update order status in the dropship order feed via [Updating Order Status](/api/supplier-orders/#updating-order-status). 

##### Example Request

    PUT https://dropshipdemo.iqmetrix.net/v1/Supplier(60455)/Orders(0b05f9fb-1210-4494-b654-d051948716b4)/OrderStatusUpdate
    Authorization: Bearer (Access Token)
    Accept: application/json
    Content-Type: application/json
    {
        "Id": "0b05f9fb-1210-4494-b654-d051948716b4",
        "Status": "Shipped",
        "Message": "No errors",
        "TrackingInfo": "23923408863",
        "ShippingProvider": "UPS"
    }


##### Example Response

    HTTP 200 OK Content-Type: application/json
    {
        "Id": "0b05f9fb-1210-4494-b654-d051948716b4",
        "Status": "Shipped",
        "TrackingInfo": "23923408863",
        "ShippingProvider": "UPS",
        "Info": null,
        "Message": "No errors"
    }


## Optional: Partial Shipments

Partial shipments are supported but are currently limited. It is **highly recommended** to ship a complete order, rather than a partially shipped order.

If an order has items that are currently unavailable but must be shipped, then you must contact <a href="mailto:support@iqmetrix.com?subject=Dropship Partial Shipment">iQmetrix Support</a> to resolve this case. In the case of partial shipments, the individual item (SKU) statuses must be updated instead of the order status. 

#### Use Cases

There are multiple use cases that may occur requiring a partial shipment. 

* A customer requests to ship all SKUs when some available. 
 * If some items are available for a SKU, then update the item's `quantity` with the amount that will be shipped and update `status` to `PartiallyShipped`.
* A customer requests to ship each SKU when all available.
 * If all items are available for a SKU, then update the item's `status` to `Shipped`.


#### Partial Order Flow Diagram

The diagram below demonstrates all possible states possible when a partial shipment occurs.

<img src="{{ "/images/order-partial-flow.jpg" | prepend: site.url }}" alt="dropship partial order states" />

An email is sent out from iQmetrix once any of the items in the order have changed to `Shipped`. 

{{note}} Only one email is sent to the customer for each entry updated, regardless of how many items are set to <strong>Shipped</strong> in that update. {{end}}


### Updating the Item Status

You must update item status in the dropship order feed via [Updating Item Status](/api/supplier-orders/#updating-item-status).


##### Example Request

    PUT /Suppliers(60455)/Orders(0b05f9fb-1210-4494-b654-d051948716b4)/OrderStatusUpdate
    Authorization: Bearer (Access Token)
    Accept: application/json
    Content-Type: application/json
    
    {
        "Id": "0b05f9fb-1210-4494-b654-d051948716b4",
        "ItemInformation": [
            {
                "Status": "Error",      
                "ProductName": "SMS L720 BLU SPT RTD",
                "Message": "Error: Product dsf could not be found",
                "Sku": "abc123",
                "TrackingInfo": 23923408863,
                "ShippingProvider": "UPS"
            },
            ...
        ]    
    }

##### Example Response


    HTTP 200 OK Content-Type: application/json
    {
        "Id": "0b05f9fb-1210-4494-b654-d051948716b4",
        "ItemInformation": [
            {
                "Sku": "abc123",
                "CatalogId": "dbc2577a-021f-4bbf-8289-ff9cac593a8b",
                "Quantity": 1,
                "Status": "Error",
                "TrackingInfo": "23923408863",
                "ShippingProvider": "UPS",
                "Info": null,
                "Message": "Error: Product dsf could not be found"
            },
            ...
        ]
    }



## Optional: Cancelling an Order

Cancelling orders is not currently supported in the API and is a manual process between the store and supplier. The store must contact the supplier to cancel the order and have a refund issued to the end customer.


## Step 4: Next Steps

Now that you have completed the basic steps getting and updating dropship orders, you can start the end-to-end testing. Please contact <a href="mailto:{{site.support_email}}?subject=Dropship End-to-End Testing">API Support</a> to begin this process.
