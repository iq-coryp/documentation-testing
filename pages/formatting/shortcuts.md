Some of the Jekyll syntax can be slow to create. Using a utility such as [aText](https://www.trankynam.com/atext/) can make creating content a lot of faster. You get aText from the App Store on a Mac for about $5.

To import the shortcut keys I'm using, see the <a href="{{ "/files/shortcuts.zip" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">shortcuts.zip</a> file. After unzipping this file, you can import it into aText.

There are alternatives to aText, such as Typeitforme. But aText seems to work the best. Read more about it on [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/5843903/the-best-text-expansion-app-for-mac).
