iQmetrix APIs are provisioned into environments that let you start developing and testing integrated solutions quickly and easily.

This document provides an outline of the environments available to you.

## Sandbox

The **sandbox** environment allows you to develop and test integrated solutions without compromising data in your production environment. 

### Uses 

* Developing or testing integrated solutions with iQmetrix APIs
* Trying out new versions of features of iQmetrix APIs

### Rate Limiting

See [Rate Limiting](/api/rate-limiting).

### Isolation

Sandbox environments are isolated from production, so operations performed in your sandbox environment don't affect your production data, and conversely.

### Test Data

Environment will be provisioned with tenant-specific dataset populated with test data.

## Production

The **production** environment allows you to use your integrated solutions once deployed
