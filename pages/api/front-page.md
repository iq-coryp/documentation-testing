## Introduction

### API Reference

The iQmetrix APIs are centered around [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) while our legacy APIs use SOAP. Our APIs use standard HTTP response codes specific to iQmetrix to indicate API errors.

We use built-in HTTP features, such as HTTP authentication and HTTP verbs, which are understood by HTTP clients. [JSON](http://json.org/) is returned by all API responses while [XML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) is returned from our legacy APIs.

### Environments

To help separate the development and integration process from production, iQmetrix provides separate accounts for the Sandbox and Production {{Environment}}. Each environment requires a set of login credentials and keys. Requests made to our Sandbox environment are isolated from our Production environment and incur no cost.

### Authentication

When using our APIs your account must be [authenticated](/api/authentication/) by including your secret API key in the request. We use [OAuth2](http://oauth.net/2/) authentication, and your application must first obtain an{{AccessToken_Glossary}} to make authorized requests. All requests must be made over [HTTPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS).

Requests made over plain HTTP or without authentication will fail.

### Rate Limits

[Rate limits](/api/rate-limiting) are on a per service basis.
