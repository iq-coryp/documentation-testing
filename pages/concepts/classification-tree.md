Classification Trees are a key part of Product Library and your Catalog as they organize all your products into Categories and Classifications.

Classification Trees are also used by downstream consumers like Dropship and Shelf.

### Managing Classification Trees

Currently, Classification Trees are managed by the iQmetrix Curation team.

### Categories vs Classifications

Categories are used for organization and do not contain any products.

Classifications are always children of Categories as well as being leaf nodes in the tree.

As a rule, products always belong to a single Classification.

### Types of Classification Trees

Products in different industries are contained in their own respective trees.

The examples below show Classification Trees for the clothing and wireless industries. 

### General Example

In the Apparel & Accessories tree, there are high level Categories for Clothing and Shoes, both of which are then broken down into further Categories for Men and Women. 

As you go down the tree, the tops Category has Classifications for Tees, Shirts, Sweaters and Jackets. The Bottoms category is broken down in a similar fashion.

### Wireless Example

In the Cellular & Accessories tree, we have split up most of the tree based on Devices and Accessories. 

Smartphones and Voice & Message Phones are both Classifications under the Phones category.
