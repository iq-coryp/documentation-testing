## Introduction to the iQmetrix API

### Welcome to the iQmetrix Developer Portal

This is where we invite third-party developers, partners and clients to learn more about development and integration opportunities via the iQmetrix Platform API.

All our Platform services are designed with a publicly-facing REST API as a first-class citizen. This is the same API that our own developers use to build various products
